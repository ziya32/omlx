"""
Engine abstraction for oMLX inference.

Provides multiple engine implementations:
- BatchedEngine: Continuous batching for multiple concurrent users
- VLMBatchedEngine: Vision-language model engine with image support
- EmbeddingEngine: Batch embedding generation using mlx-embeddings
- RerankerEngine: Document reranking (SequenceClassification + CausalLM yes/no)
- STTEngine: Speech-to-text transcription using mlx-audio
- TTSEngine: Text-to-speech synthesis using Qwen3-TTS via mlx-audio

Also re-exports core engine components for backwards compatibility.
