"""Conditional MTP dispatch inside ``mlx_lm.generate.GenerationBatch``.

This is the integration point that lets the existing oMLX scheduler /
paged cache / prefix cache / SSD cache stack drive MTP without touching any
of those layers. ``GenerationBatch`` is mlx-lm's per-step decoder for the
active set of sequences in continuous batching. We patch:

- ``GenerationBatch.__init__`` — after the standard ``_step()`` has run
  the prompt's last token through the backbone, we add an MTP "post-init"
  step that runs one more 1-token backbone forward (with hidden) and one
  MTP-head forward. Two confirmed tokens are queued for emission and a
  draft is stashed for the first verify cycle.

- ``GenerationBatch.next`` — when the batch holds exactly one MTP-capable
  sequence we emit from the per-batch queue first; once empty, we run a
  2-token verify forward over ``[next_main, draft]`` with
  ``n_confirmed=1`` and a single MTP-head forward at the bonus position
  (accept) or confirmed position (reject), refilling the queue from the
  verify outputs.

The throughput math (greedy, accept rate p):
  - Cost per *cycle*: 1× backbone (2-token verify) + 1× MTP head ≈ 1.15
  - Tokens per cycle: 1 + p (accept emits draft+bonus; reject emits verify_pred only)
  - At p≈1: 0.575 cost/token → ~1.74× throughput
  - At p≈0.5: ~0.77 cost/token → ~1.30× throughput

Greedy identity (sampler is None): the patched dispatch produces the same
tokens as the standard step. PR 990's ``test_mtp_generate_identity``
encodes this contract; the oMLX-side equivalent lives in
``tests/test_mlx_lm_mtp_patch.py``.

Stochastic acceptance (sampler is not None): we use ``min(1, p_target / p_draft)``
(Leviathan & Chen 2023). On rejection we sample from the residual
``max(p_target - p_draft, 0) / Z`` so the marginal output distribution
equals the target distribution exactly.

PagedCacheManager interaction
-----------------------------
``cache.trim(1)`` on a ``BatchKVCache`` only updates ``self._idx``; the
underlying paged blocks are untouched. ``ArraysCache.rollback_state``
holds ``(conv_snap, ssm_snap)`` snapshots produced by the patched
``GatedDeltaNet.__call__`` and is restored on reject. Because both code
paths only mutate cache *length* (not block ownership), oMLX's
``PagedCacheManager`` is oblivious to the trim — its block_table is
unaffected and prefix-cache lookups continue to work normally.

TokenBuffer interaction
-----------------------
``GenerationBatch._token_context[0]`` is a ``TokenBuffer`` accumulating
the prompt + every forward-input token. We update it in lock-step with
each forward-input position so that ``logits_processors`` see the same
token sequence the standard step would see. On reject we shrink the
buffer's ``_size`` by 1 to discard the rejected draft (mirroring PR 990's
``prev_tokens = prev_tokens[:-1]``).
