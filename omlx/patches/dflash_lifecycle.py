"""Lifecycle wrap for dflash-mlx's class-level monkey patches.

dflash-mlx patches linear-attention / attention ``__call__`` at the class
level (``cls.__call__ = speculative_call`` etc.) inside its hook installer
functions, and uses class attributes like ``_dflash_speculative_call_installed``
as idempotency guards. Those patches persist for the lifetime of the
Python process — engine teardown does not undo them. Two engines sharing
a Python class then see crossed-over state: a later Native MTP load after
a DFlash session ends up with the dflash hook on ``linear_attn.__call__``
and the MTP draft cycle crashes with
``TypeError: speculative_call() got an unexpected keyword argument 'n_confirmed'``
(issue #1388).

This module wraps each dflash hook installer so oMLX can:
  - capture the pre-dflash ``__call__`` before dflash overwrites it
  - on ``restore_dflash_class_patches()`` (called from ``DFlashEngine.stop()``),
    revert each touched class to that captured state and clear dflash's
    idempotency flag so a subsequent DFlash load can re-arm cleanly

The wrap is idempotent and runs once per process — typically at the
beginning of ``DFlashEngine.start()`` just before ``load_target_bundle``.
